# Stock picking machine learning algorithm

## Objective target
...

## Approach
1. Importing necessary packages for financial analysis
2. Deciding on which markets to choose for the analysis (region/sector)
3. Selecting suitable indicators (technical/fundamental)
4. Importing relevant data from the internet
5. Cleaning and preparing data
6. Trying different machine learning algorithms (K-NN/MMH/LR/DNN etc. -> Luis) which distinguishe between the two classes buys and sells
7. Validating the algorithms with historic and current data 
8. Visualizing the performance of the different algorithms and suitable indices
9. Choosing the best algorithm
10. Applying it to the current market situation
